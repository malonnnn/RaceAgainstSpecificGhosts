# Ghosts

## Requires:
  * [Trackmania 2020](https://www.trackmania.com/) (duh)
  * Club Access Only (cuz only Club gets cool ghost stuff, #blameNadeoUbisoft)
  * [Openplanet](https://openplanet.nl)

## How to install:

  * [Openplanet](https://openplanet.nl/tutorials/installation)
  * [The Plugin](https://openplanet.nl/tutorials/installing-plugins)

## How to use after installing:

  1. Load the map you want the ghost for
  (example: Winter 2021 - 25)

  2. In the Scripts dropdown menu of Openplanet, choose "Ghost to Race"  

  3. In the popup window, put in the trackmania.io link of the ghost you want to race  
  (example: <https://trackmania.io/api/download/ghost/5a1796df-557d-4aff-a44e-d473b1477e47>)  
  or the path of the replay file  
  (example: C:\Users\<YourUserName>\Downloads\pupu.Replay.Gbx)

## To remove ghosts:

  * Reload the map, "Drive Alone" doesn't work

## My personal use for the plugin:

  * To extract the author model ghost
  * To search the leaderboards for other racers who tied (or near-tied) author model ghost
  * Race them all together

####  **Why is it useful?**

  * It let's you know if you are "too far behind" for author time
  * As long as someone's behind you, you're always guaranteed on pace
  * It really helps for pushing, trying to keep up
