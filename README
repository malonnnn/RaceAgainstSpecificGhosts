Requires:
  * Trackmania 2020 (duh)
  * Club Access Only (cuz only Club gets cool ghost stuff, #blameNadeoUbisoft)
  * OpenPlanet 

How to install:
  * https://openplanet.nl/tutorials/installation
  * https://openplanet.nl/tutorials/installing-plugins

How to use after installing:
  1. Load the map you want the ghost for
  (example: Winter 2021 - 25)

  2. In the Scripts dropdown menu of OpenPlanet, choose "Ghost to Race"  

  3. In the popup window, put in the trackmania.io link of the ghost you want to race  
  (example: https://trackmania.io/api/download/ghost/5a1796df-557d-4aff-a44e-d473b1477e47)  
  or the path of the replay file  
  (example: C:\Users\pp\Downloads\pupu.Replay.Gbx)

To remove ghosts:
  * Reload the map, "Drive Alone" doesn't work

My personal use for the plugin:
  * To extract the author model ghost
  * To search the leaderboards for other racers who tied (or near-tied) author model ghost
  * Race them all together
  Why is it useful?
    * It let's you know if you are "too far behind" for author time
    * As long as someone's behind you, you're always guaranteed on pace
    * It really helps for pushing, trying to keep up
